# Chess
This is a small personal project to implment a Chess game. Initially starting with a basic 2 player game before potentially looking at an AI opponent.

This will be created using a blazor app with .Net and .NetCore. Depending on how much time is invested in this, it may eventually be hosted on AWS. For now see below for how to run and play.

# Run
Download the project

Navigate to the desired folder in a command prompt

dotNet run

This will run in a localhost browser on port 5001
